  abstract = {Autoethnography is an approach to research and writing that seeks to describe and systematically analyze personal experience in order to understand cultural experience. This approach challenges canonical ways of doing research and representing others and treats research as a political, socially-just and socially-conscious act. A researcher uses tenets of autobiography and ethnography to do and write autoethnography. Thus, as a method, autoethnography is both process and product.

  abstract = {In this thesis, I propose an alternative conception of speculation within design-research that moves away from envisioning provocative futures and towards processes of ethical engagement. This informs a new framing of speculation within the context of design-research, that is first explored in the context of my designer-led inquiry and then revisited and troubled through contact with a participatory HCI research with LGBT young people. I reflect upon critical and speculative design through the lens of recent developments in speculative research and feminist STS to form an account of these as a practice of `staying with the trouble'. I situate speculation not as an abstract thought experiment or future vision but as an embodied, material and social practice that is produced through the coupling of design and research. By hyphenating design-research, I view this practice as a co-production which is neither defined by the fixed prepositional relationship of through/into/for, nor is comfortably hybrid. This framing draws focus to the borders and breakdowns of design-research and as a result my reflective and diffractive account of design research practice centres on a series of transformative events. By dwelling on these moments of uncertainty and metamorphosis, I examine how design-research produces a tension between being present and making representations. Across these events, I find that design-research as a speculative practice is haunted by a range of absent presences that both enable and constrain speculation. I propose that design-research is a diffractive as well as reflective methodology that produces knowledge that makes a difference in the world. I explore this common ground between design-research and diffractive methodologies (Haraway, 1994, Barad, 2007) and use these to shape the structure and style of this thesis. The resulting stories of dysfunctional wifi networks, haunted transcripts, camp machines, idiotic encounters, drunken screens, absent police officers, radio reporters, evangelists, and wearabledata analysis paint a picture of design-research as a practice that produces knowledge in material-discursive forms that can translate speculative events into shared spaces of wonder and concern.},

We explore ``failure'' expansively\textemdash turning away from tidy success narratives toward messy unfoldings and reflexive discomfort\textemdash through retrospective trioethnography. Our findings reflect on failures we identified in six past design research projects: issues of relational labor of deployment, mismatched designer/participant imaginaries, burden of participation, and invisibility of researcher labor. Our discussion contributes to broader reflections on shifting design research practice: (a) methodological considerations inviting others to engage failures through retrospective trioethnography, (b) letting go as a mode of research care, (c) possibilities for more candid research reporting, and (d) how centering failure may contribute to design justice by providing a technique for attending to harm and healing in design research practices. Throughout, we call for challenging success narratives in design research, and underscore the need for systemic changes in design research practice.},

  abstract = {Third wave HCI initiated a slow transformation in the methods of UX research: from widely used quantitative approaches to more recently employed qualitative techniques. Articulating the nuances, complexity, and diversity of a user's experience beyond surface descriptions remains a challenge within design. One qualitative method \textemdash{} micro-phenomenology \textemdash{} has been used in HCI/Design research since 2001. Yet, no systematic understanding of micro-phenomenology has been presented, particularly from the perspective of HCI/Design researchers who actively use it in design contexts. We interviewed 5 HCI/Design experts who utilize micro-phenomenology and present their experiences with the method. We illustrate how this method has been applied by the selected experts through developing a practice, and present conditions under which the descriptions of the experience unfold, and the values that this method can provide to HCI/Design field. Our contribution highlights the value of micro-phenomenology in articulating the experience of designers and participants, developing vocabulary for multi-sensory experiences, and unfolding embodied tacit knowledge.},

Compared to other subjective methods, micro-phenomenology evokes and returns one to the moment of experience, allowing access to dimensions and observations which may not be recalled in reflection alone. We present a case study of five micro-phenomenological interviews conducted with musicians about their experiences with existing digital musical instruments. The interviews reveal deep, clear descriptions of different modalities of synchronic moments in interaction, especially in tactile connections and bodily sensations. We highlight the elements of interaction captured in these interviews which would not have been revealed otherwise and the importance of these elements in researching perception, understanding, interaction, and performance with digital musical instruments.},

  abstract = {Contemporary culture increasingly suffers from problems of attention, over-stimulation, and stress, and a variety of personal and social discontents generated by deceptive body images. This book argues that improved body consciousness can relieve these problems and enhance one's knowledge, performance, and pleasure. The body is our basic medium of perception and action, but focused attention to its feelings and movements has long been criticised as a damaging distraction that also ethically corrupts through self-absorption. In Body Consciousness, Richard Shusterman refutes such charges by engaging the most influential twentieth-century somatic philosophers and incorporating insights from both Western and Asian disciplines of body-mind awareness. Rather than rehashing intractable ontological debates on the mind-body relation, Shusterman reorients study of this crucial nexus towards a more fruitful, pragmatic direction that reinforces important but neglected connections between philosophy of mind, ethics, politics, and the pervasive aesthetic dimensions of everyday life.},
