It is focused on the difficulties of becoming aware of one's subjective experience and describing it, and on the processes used by this interview technique to overcome each of these difficulties. The article ends with a discussion of the criteria governing the validity of the descriptions obtained, and then with a brief review of the functions of these descriptions.},\n  langid = {english},\n  file = {/Users/eevee/Zotero/storage/HMP698QZ/Petitmengin - 2006 - Describing oneâ€™s subjective experience in the seco.pdf}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{prpa2020,\n  title = {Articulating {{Experience}}: {{Reflections}} from {{Experts Applying Micro-Phenomenology}} to {{Design Research}} in {{HCI}}},\n  shorttitle = {Articulating {{Experience}}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2020 {{CHI Conference}} on {{Human Factors}} in {{Computing Systems}}},\n  author = {Prpa, Mirjana and {Fdili-Alaoui}, Sarah and Schiphorst, Thecla and Pasquier, Philippe},\n  year = {2020},\n  series = {{{CHI}} '20},\n  pages = {1--14},\n  publisher = {{Association for Computing Machinery}},\n  address = {{New York, NY, USA}},\n  doi = {10/ghnn6x},\n  abstract = {Third wave HCI initiated a slow transformation in the methods of UX research: from widely used quantitative approaches to more recently employed qualitative techniques. Articulating the nuances, complexity, and diversity of a user's experience beyond surface descriptions remains a challenge within design. One qualitative method \\textemdash{} micro-phenomenology \\textemdash{} has been used in HCI/Design research since 2001. Yet, no systematic understanding of micro-phenomenology has been presented, particularly from the perspective of HCI/Design researchers who actively use it in design contexts. We interviewed 5 HCI/Design experts who utilize micro-phenomenology and present their experiences with the method. We illustrate how this method has been applied by the selected experts through developing a practice, and present conditions under which the descriptions of the experience unfold, and the values that this method can provide to HCI/Design field. Our contribution highlights the value of micro-phenomenology in articulating the experience of designers and participants, developing vocabulary for multi-sensory experiences, and unfolding embodied tacit knowledge.},\n  isbn = {978-1-4503-6708-0},\n  keywords = {empirical methods,micro-phenomenology,user experience}\n}\n"}}}}
